      <p className="mb-3">
        I graduated from BIMM Dublin with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium italic">
          Commercial Modern Music
        </span>
        {" "}in 2023. After graduating, I decided to pursue my passion for programming and web development.
        I have been actively creating software and writing my own apps for nearly a decade using various programming languages
        and technologies such as{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">
          HTML, CSS, javascript, React, C#
        </span>
        , and more. I enrolled in the{" "}
        <span className="font-medium italic">
          Meta Professional Front-end Developer
        </span>
        {" "}course, a 6 month certificate programme, to ensure my knowledge of web
        development was up to scratch with industry standards. My favourite part of programming is
        <span className="font-medium italic">
          {" "}solving problems in creative and elegant ways, and constantly learning about new technologies.
        </span>
        {" "}I am currently looking to turn my passion into a{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">
          full-time position
        </span>
        {" "}as a software developer.<br></br><br></br>
        When I'm not programming, I love practicing the guitar. I was in a band for seven years, 
        and while I no longer wish to pursue a career in music, I will always love learning new scales and chords,
        and improving myself as a musician.
